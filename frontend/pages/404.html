            <p class="text">Andrea's collection, Broadcasting, was published by <a href="http://www.gatehousepress.com/" target="_blank">Gatehouse Press</a> (2013) as the winner of the <a href="http://www.cafewriters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Café Writers</a> Norfolk Commission Award for poetry. Since the book focuses on the 1942 requisition of several Norfolk villages for D-Day training, it should interest readers of poetry but also anyone interested in East Anglian or regional history. Should you feel inclined, you can buy <i>Broadcasting</i> below.

                        "Broadcasting is less about remembrance than the way we forget... the slow erasure of local customs, sayings and memories. Just as the bricks and mortar of once-loved homes are taken back by the landscape, "asleep with bramble"; what's left are glimpses and fragments – the smell of russet apples, the gritty texture of rabbit picked from the bone, the "sweet twirl" of a folk dance – but these only serve to emphasise the sense of absence in these poignant poems (which) reveal the hidden casualties of a war we thought we knew." - <a href="http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/" target="_blank">Bloodaxe</a> poet Esther Morgan.

            <blockquote>
                "Andrea Holland's poems treat their historical material with respect - but it is the easy respect of true acquaintance. She re-imagines the scenes of country life in wartime with vivid, present detail that grows from a love of the landscape as well as research, and is animated by a special sensitivity to loss. Far from distancing the place and people, her inventive, even playful language gives them back their life" - <a href="http://www.philipgross.co.uk/" target="_blank">Philip Gross</a> (T.S. Eliot award winning poet, inc The Water Table, Deep Field, The Egg of Zero, Mappa Mundi) on Broadcasting.
