<p class="text"><i>I do not want to make a stone horse</i></p>
<p class="text"><i>that is trying to and cannot smell the air,</i></p>
<p class="text">said Barbara Hepworth, the woman who disappears in fire.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">There is a woman who disappears in fire</p>
<p class="text">every time the sun drops over the stairs</p>
<p class="text">of her studio, as she makes a stone horse</p>
<br>
<p class="text">which does not look like a stone horse:</p>
<p class="text">she’s all for abstraction, the sculpted mare</p>
<p class="text">will look like solid wood as it disappears in fire.</p>
<br>
<p class="text">In the Cornish garden, bronze sculptures disappear in fire</p>
<p class="text">as the sun burns through the greenhouse, on the Maidenhair</p>
<p class="text">fern and Bougainvillea beneath the glass. A stone horse</p>
<br>
<p class="text">among the flowers, she gets it right, a stone horse</p>
<p class="text">which breathes among flowers, in a lair</p>
<p class="text">of Angel’s trumpets. The pollen disappears in fire</p>
<br>
<p class="text">as a fat bee glows like a coal disappearing into fire.</p>
<p class="text">It spreads the pollen and goes home, where</p>
<p class="text">something happens and honey is made; as a stone horse</p>
<br>
<p class="text">is sculpted, something happens.  The woman, a stone horse,</p>
<p class="text">the studio all burn up, there’s no air</p>
<p class="text">left to breath: eyes, nostrils, hair - it all disappears in fire.</p>
